# Readium

The Medium-like theme for [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost).

![Readium 2.0](http://cl.ly/VBX3/readium2.jpg)

Check out [Mark Reads Blog](http://mark-read.info) as an good example.

Just drop this theme in your Ghost theme folder and choose it in your Ghost admin dashboard (after restarting Ghost).

For big article images in your posts give it the tag "articleImage". If this tag gets added to an article, you should add an additional big image
to the beginning. The JS goes out and takes the first image inside this article and uses it as article image.

If you give your images an alt text, it gets added automatically as figcaption beneath the image (sorry, no links or other HTML stuff). Awesomeness!
