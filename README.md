# Readium Ghost Theme 1.2

Hey there, my name is Sven Read. I love building themes & I love [Ghost](https://en.ghost.org). And I always wanted to have a possibility to blog that's similar to Medium.com,
but without the drawbacks (like no control over your data & loss of all rights to your content, etc.). So I made myself a theme for Ghost
that takes the good parts from Medium.com & mixes them with stuff I would do differently. And this is what I ended up with.

Don't forget to check out my other themes [Marisa](http://crtv.mk/eOTs) & [Chiara](http://crtv.mk/tSYt).

## Features

## If your Ghost blog is self hosted:
1. Copy the contents of the .zip file into /content/themes/. 
2. You need to restart your Ghost instance. After that you can switch themes inside your Ghost admin (http://your.domain.com/ghost/settings/general/). Scroll down and choose "Chiara" from the theme dropdown.
3. Now you can customize your logo, langing page image (if you choose to have one), as well as user images and texts to fit the theme.
4. Have fun.

## If your Ghost blog is hosted on the Ghost hosting platform:
1. Upload your Zip file via the Ghost admin panel.
2. Switch your theme to the Marisa theme.
3. Have fun.

## Usage
- If you want a big article image, just give it the this alt attribute -> alt="img-post-cover".
- You should pay attention to image size. Don't go to wild.
- Some style configuration possible inside essentials.less.

## Future Todo
- Implement [Fluidbox](http://terrymun.github.io/Fluidbox/)
- Implement Featured Posts
- Pimp Sidebar Navigation
